# Your Home in Space: The Habitat Layout Creator

## Summary
?????
## Why this??
### 🚀 Artemis and the Moon
- NASA plans to **return humans to the Moon** through the **Artemis campaign**.  
- Goal: **enable a sustained human presence** on the lunar surface.
- The Moon will act as a **proving ground** for:
  - Technologies
  - Operational approaches
  - Preparation for **future Mars missions**
---
### 🛰️ Space Habitats
- Can support crews in three contexts:
  - **On the Moon**.
  - **In transit to Mars**.
  - **On the Martian surface**.
- Benefits:
  - Enable **longer mission durations**
  - Support **larger crew sizes**
  - Allow **comprehensive science investigations**  
---
### 🏗️ Design Considerations
- Habitat designers must account for:  
  - **Structural, manufacturing, and material options**  
  - **Delivery and deployment constraints**, such as:  
    - Capacity of lunar landing systems  
    - Launch vehicle limitations  
---
### ⚙️ Habitat Functions
- A habitat must provide **numerous life-support functions** to:  
  - Sustain the **required number of crew members**  
  - Cover the **entire mission duration**  
  - Support crews **at the destination** and **during transit**  
---
#### 🏗️ Classes of Space Habitat Structures
1. **Metallic Habitats**
   - Launched from Earth in their **usable form**.
   - Ready to occupy immediately after deployment.
1. **Inflatable Habitats**
   - **Stowed compactly** for launch.
   - **Deployed and expanded** at the point of use (e.g., on the Moon or Mars).
1. **In-Situ Manufactured Habitats**
   - **Constructed on the planetary surface**.
   - Can use **indigenous/local resources** (e.g., lunar or Martian regolith).

# User Pain Problem: Space Habitat Design Tools

## 1. Time-Consuming Design Process
- Creating a **concept for a space habitat** requires evaluating **structural forms, layouts, volumes, and systems integration**.  
- Each iteration can take **days or weeks**, slowing down early exploration.  
- Example: A designer testing both **inflatable** and **metallic habitats** must redraw layouts and redo volume calculations in separate software tools.  

📖 *Resource:* NASA’s “Habitat Design Volume Reference” (NASA/TP-2015-218570) highlights how habitat volume allocation alone is a non-trivial task.

---

## 2. Complexity of Existing Tools
- Tools like **CATIA**, **SolidWorks**, or **ANSYS** are powerful but:
  - Require **engineering-level expertise**.
  - Demand training before a designer can be productive.  
- Example: An architect interested in **crew living space ergonomics** must either learn aerospace CAD software or rely on engineers to generate basic models.  

📖 *Resource:* NASA Johnson Space Center reports note the **steep learning curve** for CAD/CAE tools in space architecture design.

---

## 3. Missing or Incomplete Features
- Many tools are not tailored for **space-specific needs**, such as:
  - Microgravity accommodations.  
  - Radiation shielding requirements.  
  - Life-support system volume allocation.  
- Example: A designer using **SketchUp** can draft interior modules, but the tool won’t calculate **shielding thickness vs. radiation dose**.  
- Designers often **combine multiple tools** (e.g., Blender + Excel + MATLAB) to fill gaps, creating inefficiency.  

📖 *Resource:* NASA’s “Advanced Exploration Systems Habitat Systems Roadmap” (2017) identifies missing design integration between habitability and system engineering tools.

---

## 4. The Core Pain
- **Designing space habitats is slow, complex, and fragmented** with current tools.  
- Pain points in summary:
  - Too much **time spent on iteration**.  
  - Tools demand **expert-level knowledge**.  
  - Lack of **domain-specific features**.  
- Outcome: Designers face **frustration**, wasted effort, and reduced innovation speed.  

📖 *Resource:* International Conference on Environmental Systems (ICES) papers repeatedly emphasize the **need for faster, more integrated design tools** for habitat studies.
