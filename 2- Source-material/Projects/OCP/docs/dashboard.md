we want a dashboard that not just the user can put charts in it we want to give the runing opencode instance also to act on the dashboard 

like if we say in the chat hey put the created chart into the provided or selected dashboard window 
then the user would be able to modify on the chart as he want using the plotly.js

ah for the charts they gonna be created using plotly.py lib
and the llm host will be opencode sdk
