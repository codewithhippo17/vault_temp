## The craziest intro
every one is gonna need something to write with and something to write on,
if you do not have a sheet of paper we can pass some out, and you also gonna need to sit with an even number of people, please find your peer.

the first question i have for you guys basically is, how many of you think of yourself as creators.

I'm gonna give 45 sec, to draw a portrait of your neighbor ready, go
......wait for them to finish.
Now i want to share what you drew with the person you drew.
.....ask some Qsts about how it was?

---

The reason i want you to do this exercise is because research shows that if you ask that question of do you feel creative or not in a room full of adults only about half of them will raise their hands. and the reason why adults don't feel creative is because when they're 8 9 10 somebody told them they couldn't draw.

Or some other artistic thing that you opted out of when you're a kid because you didn't feel you're any good at it, and we tend to equate creative ability with artistic ability and that's what we are teaching the ability to show unfinished work. and the ability to participate to something that you're not good at. 
So that what we talk about when we think about creative confidence the ability to take on problems that don't have clear answers. because innovative ideas are ideas that are not yet defined.
So your willingness to take on new things whether you can draw or not is much more important than your ability to draw
.....talk about the different suites.
## innovation is not an event
..... the example of someone in a dark room come up with a new idea
##### Innovation is a process
